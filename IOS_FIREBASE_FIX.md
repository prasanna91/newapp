# iOS Firebase Deployment Target Fix

## 🔍 Issue Identified

The iOS build was failing with the following error:

```
[!] CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "firebase_core":
  In Podfile:
    firebase_core (from `.symlinks/plugins/firebase_core/ios`)

Specs satisfying the `firebase_core (from `.symlinks/plugins/firebase_core/ios`)` dependency were found, but they required a higher minimum deployment target.
```

## 🔧 Root Cause

The issue was caused by a **minimum iOS deployment target version mismatch**:

- **Current Project**: iOS 12.0
- **Firebase SDK**: Requires iOS 13.0+ (for versions firebase_core ^3.6.0 and firebase_messaging ^15.1.3)

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated iOS Deployment Target to 13.0

**Files Modified:**

- `ios/Podfile` - Updated platform requirement and post_install hook
- `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` - Updated all three build configurations:
  - Debug: `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 13.0`
  - Release: `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 13.0`
  - Profile: `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 13.0`

### 2. Created Automated Deployment Target Setup Script

**New Script**: `lib/scripts/ios/setup_deployment_target.sh`

**Features:**

- Automatically updates Podfile platform requirement
- Adds/updates post_install hook to enforce deployment target for all pods
- Cleans CocoaPods cache and derived data
- Supports dynamic deployment target configuration via `IOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` environment variable

### 3. Integrated into Build Process

**Updated**: `lib/scripts/ios/main.sh`

- Added deployment target setup as the first step in the build process
- Ensures compatibility before any Firebase installation

### 4. Updated Codemagic Configuration

**Updated**: `codemagic.yaml`

- Added `IOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET: "13.0"` to iOS build acceleration block
- Ensures consistent deployment target across all CI/CD builds

## 🎯 Benefits

### ✅ Firebase Compatibility

- ✅ Resolves Firebase SDK version conflicts
- ✅ Ensures push notification support works correctly
- ✅ Compatible with latest Firebase features

### ✅ Build Reliability

- ✅ Eliminates CocoaPods dependency resolution errors
- ✅ Provides consistent build environment
- ✅ Automated cleanup and cache management

### ✅ Future-Proofing

## 📱 Device Compatibility

**Supported iOS Versions**: iOS 13.0 and later

**Compatible Devices:**

- iPhone 6s and later
- iPad (5th generation) and later
- iPad Air 2 and later
- iPad mini 4 and later
- iPad Pro (all models)
- iPod touch (7th generation)

**Market Coverage**: ~95% of active iOS devices (as of 2024)

## 🔄 Workflow Impact

### Before Fix:

1. Build starts
2. Firebase dependency resolution fails
3. Build terminates with CocoaPods error

### After Fix:

1. **NEW**: Deployment target setup (iOS 13.0)
2. CocoaPods cache cleanup
3. Firebase dependencies resolve successfully
4. Build completes with all features enabled

## 🏗️ Technical Details

### Podfile Changes:

```ruby
# Before
# platform :ios, '12.0'

# After
platform :ios, '13.0'

post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    flutter_additional_ios_build_settings(target)
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      config.build_settings['IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'] = '13.0'
    end
  end
end
```

### Environment Variable:

```bash
# Configurable deployment target
IOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET="${IOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET:-13.0}"
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

The iOS workflow is now fully configured and ready for production use:

1. ✅ **Firebase Integration**: Push notifications and analytics
2. ✅ **Code Signing**: App Store and Ad-Hoc distribution
3. ✅ **Build Optimization**: Fast, reliable builds
4. ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive email notifications
5. ✅ **Artifact Management**: Automated IPA generation and storage
