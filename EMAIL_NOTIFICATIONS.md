### SMTP Configuration

The system supports any SMTP server. For Gmail, use these settings:

```yaml
EMAIL_SMTP_SERVER: "smtp.gmail.com"
EMAIL_SMTP_PORT: "587"
EMAIL_SMTP_USER: "your-gmail@gmail.com"
EMAIL_SMTP_PASS: "your-app-password" # Use App Password, not regular password
```

**Note**: For Gmail, you must use an App Password, not your regular password. Enable 2-factor authentication and generate an App Password.

## üîß Integration with Build Scripts

### Android Workflow

The Android build script (`lib/scripts/android/main.sh`) automatically sends notifications:

1. **Build Start**: Sent at the beginning of the build process
2. **Build Success**: Sent when APK/AAB is successfully generated
3. **Build Failed**: Sent if any step fails with error details

### iOS Workflow

The iOS build script (`lib/scripts/ios/main.sh`) automatically sends notifications:

1. **Build Start**: Sent at the beginning of the build process
2. **Build Success**: Sent when IPA is successfully generated
3. **Build Failed**: Sent if any step fails with error details

### Combined Workflow

The combined build script (`lib/scripts/combined/main.sh`) sends notifications:

1. **Build Start**: Sent at the beginning of the combined build
2. **Build Success**: Sent when both Android and iOS builds complete
3. **Build Failed**: Sent if either platform fails

## üß™ Testing

### Test Script

Use the provided test script to verify email functionality:

```bash
# Make the test script executable
chmod +x test_email_notifications.sh

# Run the test
./test_email_notifications.sh
```

This will send three test emails:

- Build Start notification
- Build Success notification
- Build Failed notification

### Manual Testing

You can also test the email system manually:

```bash
# Test build start
bash lib/scripts/utils/email_notifications.sh "start"

# Test build success
bash lib/scripts/utils/email_notifications.sh "success"

# Test build failure
bash lib/scripts/utils/email_notifications.sh "failed" "Test error message"
```

## üìß Email Templates

### Build Started Email

- **Subject**: üöÄ QuikApp Build Started - [App Name]
- **Content**: App information, customization status, integrations, and permissions
- **Purpose**: Notify that build has begun and show configuration

### Build Success Email

- **Subject**: üéâ QuikApp Build Successful - [App Name]
- **Content**: All app information plus build artifacts and download links
- **Purpose**: Confirm successful build and provide artifact access

### Build Failed Email

- **Subject**: ‚ùå QuikApp Build Failed - [App Name]
- **Content**: Error details, troubleshooting steps, and recovery options
- **Purpose**: Alert about failure and provide resolution guidance

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Emails not sending**

   - Check `ENABLE_EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS` is set to "true"
   - Verify SMTP credentials are correct
   - Ensure recipient email is valid

2. **Gmail authentication errors**

   - Use App Password instead of regular password
   - Enable 2-factor authentication
   - Check if "Less secure app access" is enabled (if not using App Password)

3. **Missing information in emails**
   - Verify all environment variables are set
   - Check that build artifacts exist in output directories
   - Ensure feature flags are properly configured

### Debug Mode

To enable debug logging, add this to your build script:

```bash
export EMAIL_DEBUG="true"
```

This will show detailed SMTP communication logs.

## üì± Mobile Responsiveness

The email templates are fully responsive and optimized for:

- **Desktop**: Full-width layout with side-by-side sections
- **Tablet**: Adaptive grid that adjusts to screen size
- **Mobile**: Stacked layout with touch-friendly buttons

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Use App Passwords**: For Gmail, always use App Passwords instead of regular passwords
2. **Test Regularly**: Run the test script before deploying to production
3. **Monitor Delivery**: Check spam folders if emails aren't received
4. **Update Credentials**: Rotate SMTP passwords regularly
5. **Backup Configuration**: Keep email configuration in secure environment variables

## üîê Security Considerations

- **SMTP Credentials**: Store passwords in secure environment variables
- **App Passwords**: Use Gmail App Passwords for better security
- **TLS Encryption**: All emails are sent over encrypted connections
- **No Sensitive Data**: Emails don't contain sensitive build information

## üìû Support

1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Verify your SMTP configuration
3. Test with the provided test script
4. Review build logs for error messages
